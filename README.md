## Sample Data

Sample data is provided for each table, including customers, payments, subscriptions, packages, channels, and their associations through package channels.

## SQL Queries

The project includes various SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation:

1. Retrieve details of customers who have made payments using a specific mode of payment, such as Credit Card or Paytm.
2. Retrieve package names and monthly fees for all packages subscribed to by customers.
3. Retrieve package IDs and names for packages with associated channels.
4. Retrieve the total number of channels subscribed to by each customer.
5. Retrieve the total count of customers who haven't subscribed to any channels.
6. Retrieve channel IDs and names for channels subscribed to by customers.
7. Retrieve the count of customers paying a monthly fee between 25 and 60.
8. Retrieve channel and package names chosen by each customer.
9. Retrieve channel names active in the month of June.
10. Retrieve customer names, IDs, and subscription end dates for payments made in April.
11. Retrieve the number of customers who havenâ€™t made payments in April or June.
12. Find the total number of payments made by customers with subscriptions to packages having more than 15 channels.
13. Retrieve the average monthly fee for packages subscribed to within a specific date range.
14. Retrieve the count of each mode of payment in descending order.
15. Find customers who subscribed to a package with a monthly fee greater than 50 but haven't made any payments yet.
16. Retrieve customer IDs and names of customers subscribed to packages with monthly fees above the average.
